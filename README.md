# Weekly Challenge #27 - Mouse Programming

This is a solution for https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-27-mouse-programming.

I'm calling it "BFDDR". On the beat, hover your mouse over the character you want to add to your program. [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) conveniently has only eight commands in the grammar, so with those and a backspace we can make a 3x3 [DDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution) board and dance our way to any possible program.
